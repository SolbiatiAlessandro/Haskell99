After being attached to Python for couple of years I finally made my step into learning functional programming (after having attended [this](https://www.meetup.com/Weekly-Functional-Programming-Meetup/events/mlhjtqyzfbvb/) meetup in Boston)

Structure
=========
- problems are inside /src as modules
- I install Chronos.Bench to benchmark the complexity of my implementations compared to the Haskell 'standard library'
- I am using Stack as a package manager for Haskell, inside h99.cabal
